# NeuroBIM
AI-Powered Automation Platform for Architecture &amp; Engineering Workflows

##Overview
**NeuroBIM** is a next-generation, AI-powered platform designed to automate and streamline architectural and engineering (A/E) workflows. It bridges the gap between design, data, and delivery by providing a unified environment that integrates 2D/3D modeling, document processing, design validation, and smart object generation using machine learning and rule-based systems.

## Key Features

- 🔍 **2D to 3D Model Conversion** – Automatically reconstruct BIM objects from 2D drawings.
- 🤖 **AI-Driven Object Recognition** – Detect furniture, structure, annotations from floorplans and sections.
- 📄 **Document Intelligence** – Extract project data from PDFs, DWGs, and scanned drawings.
- 🛠️ **Rule-Based Parametric Modeling** – Define customizable logic for repetitive modeling tasks.
- 🧠 **Semantic Classification** – Use AI to classify and tag architectural elements.
- 📐 **Geometry Fusion & Validation** – Merge plan, elevation, section into consistent 3D form.
- 📊 **Reporting & Export** – Output schedules, quantities, or IFC/Revit-ready objects.

## Tech Stack

- 🖥️ **Frontend**: React, Three.js, TailwindCSS
- 🧠 **AI Models**: YOLOv8, LayoutLMv3, DiT, Transformers, OpenCV
- 🗂️ **Backend**: FastAPI / Node.js
- 💾 **Database**: PostgreSQL + PostGIS
- 📐 **CAD/BIM Integration**: Revit API, IFC, Speckle
